# Randomly_Useful_Commands
Mostly useful one-liners or commands in bash/unix

## Calculate the mean # of reads in all fastq files in a directory +/- SD
find fastp -type f -name '*R1.fastq' | parallel --bar "awk '(NR%4==1){count++} END {print \"{}\", count}' {}" | tee read_counts.txt | awk '{sum+=$2; sumsq+=$2*$2; n++} END {mean=sum/n; sd=sqrt(sumsq/n - mean^2); print "Mean:", mean, "SD:", sd}'

## Same as aove but also include median, and remove "Undetermined" files
find fastp -type f -name '*R1.fastq' | grep -Ev "(Undetermined-S20_R1.fastq|Undetermined-S20_R2.fastq)" | parallel -j 80 --bar "awk '(NR%4==1){count++} END {print \"{}\", count}' {}" | tee read_counts.txt | awk '
{counts[NR] = $2; sum+=$2; sumsq+=$2*$2; n++}
END {
    # Compute mean & standard deviation
    mean = sum / n;
    sd = sqrt(sumsq / n - mean^2);

    # Sort the counts array and compute the median
    asort(counts);
    if (n % 2 == 1) {
        median = counts[int(n/2) + 1];  # Odd number of values
    } else {
        median = (counts[n/2] + counts[n/2 + 1]) / 2;  # Even number of values
    }

    # Print results
    print "Mean:", mean, "SD:", sd, "Median:", median;
}'
